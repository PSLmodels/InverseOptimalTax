  abstract={We measure the redistributive preferences of Dutch political parties using unique, detailed information from their election proposals. By employing the inverse optimal-tax method, we calculate the political weights across the income distribution for each political party. We find that all Dutch political parties give a higher political weight to middle incomes than to the poor. Moreover, the political weights of the rich are close to zero. Furthermore, we detect a strong political status quo bias as the political weights of all political parties hardly deviate from the weights implied by the pre-existing tax system. We argue that political-economy considerations are key in understanding these results.},

  abstract={This paper provides a method to measure the traditional Kaldor-Hicks notion of “economic efficiency” when taxes affect behavior. In contrast to traditional unweighted surplus, measuring efficiency requires weighting individual benefits (or surplus) by the marginal cost to the government of providing a $1 transfer at each income level. These weights correspond to the solution to the “inverse-optimum” program in optimal tax: they are the social planning weights that would rationalize the status quo tax schedule as optimal. I estimate the weights using the universe of US income tax returns from 2012. The results suggest that measuring economic efficiency requires weighting surplus accruing to the poor roughly 1.5-2 times more than surplus accruing to the rich. This is because $1 of surplus to the poor can be turned into roughly $1.5-$2 of surplus to the rich by reducing the progressivity of the tax schedule. Following Kaldor and Hicks’ original applications, I compare income distributions over time in the US and across countries. The results suggest US economic growth is 15-20\% lower due to increased inequality than is suggested by changes in GDP. Because of its higher inequality, the U.S. is unable to replicate the income distribution of countries like Austria and the Netherlands, despite having higher national income per capita.},

  abstract={Calculating the welfare implications of changes to economic policy or shocks requires economists to decide on a normative criterion. One approach is to elicit the relevant moral criteria from real-world policy choices, converting a normative decision into a positive inference, as in the recent surge of “inverse-optimum” research. We find that capitalizing on the potential of this approach is not as straightforward as we might hope. We perform the inverse-optimum inference on U.S. tax policy from 1979 through 2010 and argue that the results either undermine the normative relevance of the approach or challenge conventional assumptions upon which economists routinely rely when performing welfare evaluations.},

  abstract={Which equity principles does the tax system reflect? This paper provides, first, a theoretical framework to reveal implicit social equity principles from tax policy. Second, the approach is applied to measure the effect of the equity principle ”equal treatment” in tax systems. A concern for equal treatment is modelled as a further constraint on tax policy, increasing the implicit costs of redistribution, thereby making the welfare weight schedule more steep across the income distribution. Using Norwegian data, I measure the size of this increase, and use it to separate the effects of the concerns for equal treatment (horizontal equity) and inequality reduction (vertical equity) that go in to the social preference for marginal income increases at each point in the distribution. This leads to an reinterpretation of steep welfare weights schedules, showing that they do not simply reflect a priority for low income individuals, but also self-imposed constraints on tax instruments derived from equity views indifferent to (vertical) inequality.},

  abstract={This paper proposes to evaluate tax reforms by aggregating money metric losses and gains of different individuals using \&quot;generalized social marginal welfare weights.\&quot; Optimum tax formulas take the same form as standard welfarist tax formulas by simply substituting standard marginal social welfare weights with those generalized weights. Weights directly capture society's concerns for fairness without being necessarily tied to individual utilities. Suitable weights can help reconcile discrepancies between the welfarist approach and actual tax practice, as well as unify in an operational way the most prominent alternatives to utilitarianism such as Libertarianism, equality of opportunity, or poverty alleviation.

  abstract={For any policy question with distributional implications, the planner's social welfare function plays an important role in shaping the optimal policy. In the context of an optimal taxation problem in which individuals differ ex ante with respect to labor productivity, the planner's social welfare function defines the relative Pareto weights placed on individuals with different productivities. In this paper, we show that if one assumes that the observed income tax schedule has been chosen optimally, then it is sometimes possible to derive a closed-form expression for the social welfare function. This social welfare function involves parameters defining the shape of the observed tax and transfer system, as well as parameters defining preference elasticities and the shape of the underlying cross-sectional productivity distribution. The key result is that inverse optimum problem (finding a social welfare function that justifies a given tax function) is tractable in quantitatively relevant cases where the optimum problem (solving for the optimal tax function for a given social welfare function) is not. In particular, the inverse optimum problem is tractable given a standard utility specification with curvature over both consumption and labor effort. This tractability makes it easier to understand how optimal taxation works.},

  abstract={This paper derives optimal income tax formulas using compensated and uncompensated elasticities of earnings with respect to tax rates. A simple formula for the high income optimal tax rate is obtained as a function of these elasticities and the thickness of the top tail of the income distribution. In the general non-linear income tax problem, this method using elasticities shows precisely how the different economic effects come into play and which are the key relevant parameters in the optimal income tax formulas of Mirrlees. The optimal non-linear tax rate formulas are expressed in terms of elasticities and the shape of the income distribution. These formulas are implemented numerically using empirical earning distributions and a range of realistic elasticity parameters.},
